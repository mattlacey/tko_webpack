# WIP

Ths is a template Total KnockOut application using webpack as the build tool. Webpack configuration is var from ideal and not at all final!

## Building and Running

* After cloning the repo, run `npm install`
* Run the build (with FS watching) via `npm run build`

## Directories (liable to change)

`/src/` - Root directory for the main JavaScript entry point as well as app-level JS modules
`/src/components/` - Web Components extending `ko.Component` go in here
